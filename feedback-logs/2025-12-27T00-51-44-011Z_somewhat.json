  "comment": "I think the challenge was, it seems like you assumed six big blinds per hundred at 10/20, but I'm deciding to move up to 10/20. I'm not there yet, so I told you my win rate at lower stakes. Or at least that's what I meant. I wasn't clear maybe the way you were asking, but also the recommended bankroll is really low. We have to be a lot more careful. I think you should be a lot more careful with the feedback you give out and the advice you give because people can go broke based on this.",
